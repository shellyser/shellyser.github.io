####Flatiron School Fellowship 

I am very excited to finally have my blog setup (well, in the works at least). For building this blog I decided to give the Jekyll ruby gem a try as it seems to be a great way to get into the habit of using git, gitub and ruby. Hopefully, I will quickly get the hang of it and start messing with the code a bit more. 

#### Week 1 

First week of the Flatiron School Fellowship was for the most part an introductory week although we quickly dived into the prework from day 1. As I had suspected, the guys at Flatiron did an amazing job gathering an inspiring group of people which I look forward to working with for the remainder of the course. We also had an inspiring talk with both Adam and Avi, and got to meet one of our instructors Steven. During that week, I dived into prework, working on some HTML, CSS and Git. 

#### Week 2

The first week flew by and after getting feedback from a few Flatiron Alumni's that paid us a visit, I decided to hold off on the front end part of the prework and dive into Ruby, SQL and Rails since that would be the core of the course material. I felt relatively comfortable with the database section, it seemed to be very intuitive and easy to follow. Of course, having only worked on tutorials there is no telling how I will feel when working for real with building a database. The rails section has been much more of a struggle. The tutorials on Treehouse seem to be adding additional hardship since they use an older version of Rails making it extremely hard to follow! I guess though struggling through it will eventually help the learning process, perhaps? I hope so!

I also got my working environment set up. Terminal and Sublime are customized and pretty. Makes looking at code so much more pleasant! Everything seems to be installed but I think my path for Rails is not set up correctly, on my to-do list for next week....
