You can check out some of my work <a href="https://www.behance.net/shellyseroussi">here</a>. I am also a Flatiron School Fellow Alumni. Aside from learning how to make a nifty knot & rock karoake, I have learned some internets and worked on cool projects such as <a href="http://abodely.herokuapp.com/login" target="_blank">Abodely</a> & <a href="http://givvhub.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Givvhub</a>.</h1>
